Before, with synonyms on every line: 


Terminator
	T-800, Arnold
	T-1000, Robert


Currently, with each synonym on its own line:


Terminator
	T-800
		Arnold
	T-1000
		Robert


This is technically incorrect because it makes no distinction between abstraction ("subvariants") and equality ("synonyms"). For now this doesn't matter very much in practice. If we write the taxonomies keeping all synonyms on one line like before, we can auto-generate the new (information-losing, incorrect) version with each synonym on its own line. 

The example in yesterday's email complicates things. Consider:

Terminator
	T-800
		Arnold
		T-800A
		T-800B

	T-1000
		Robert


Problem: According to reality: 

	"T-800" = "Arnold"
	"T-800A" <: "T-800"
	"T-800B" <: "T-800"
	Therefore, "T-800B" = "Arnold"

	According to the data model:
	"Arnold" <: "T-800"
	"T-800A" <: "T-800"
	"T-800B" <: "T-800"
	Therefore, "T-800B" != "Arnold"


One solution is to make sure that only the preferred term may have subvariants. This forces the preferred term to be "T-800"

Terminator
	T-800, Arnold
		T-800A
		T-800B

	T-1000, Robert


The other solution is to extend the syntax of the taxonomy file to differentiate between subvariants and synonyms even on separate lines: 
Now, 

Terminator
	Arnold
	> T-800
		T-800A
		T-800B

	T-1000
	> Robert

By prepending some lines with a special symbol, we demarcate 
For now I am using "|" because it is consistent with BNF.

Terminator
	Arnold
	| T-800
		T-800A
		| Bad Terminator
		T-800B
		| Good Terminator

	Robert 
	| T-1000


This would be useful for entering data correctly and futureproofing: A simple script can project this back onto the old, incorrect format so that the tools that ingest the taxonomies don't need to be changed.


It also solves the problem of different synonyms having different subvariants

Terminator
	Arnold
		Schwarzenegger
	> T-800
		T-800A
		T-800B

	T-1000
	> Robert

Now, 
	Schwarzenegger <: Arnold 
	T-800A <: T-800
	T-800A ~ Arnold
	T-800A ~ Schwarzenegger
	T-800B ~ Arnold
	T-800A != T-800B
